🏞 Surface Features
Titania has a heavily cratered surface, indicating it’s an ancient moon that has experienced impacts over billions of years.

The rifts and valleys suggest geological activity in the past, possibly from tectonic processes or ice-driven resurfacing. These features give Titania a unique, fractured look.

It also has large impact craters, some of which are about 300 km wide! Many of these craters show bright walls and dark floors, suggesting that there are differences in material composition and ice in the crust.

🧊 Ice and Rock Composition
Titania’s surface is primarily water ice mixed with rocky material.

The fractures and rifts on its surface may have been caused by internal heating from tidal forces (from Uranus) or radioactive decay. These forces likely created stresses that led to the fracturing of the moon's icy shell.

🌌 Geological History
Titania’s geological activity has likely slowed down over the ages, but it’s possible that, at some point in its history, it had subsurface oceans or liquid water beneath its icy crust.

Some scientists believe that Titania, like some of the other moons of Uranus, may have experienced differentiation, meaning it once had a layered interior with a rocky core and icy outer layers.

🚀 Exploration
Voyager 2: The only spacecraft to have visited Titania, providing detailed images of its surface. These images revealed the moon’s fractured surface and impact craters, giving scientists an early view of its surface features.

There have been no follow-up missions to Titania, but with its intriguing surface and potential geological history, future missions to Uranus could offer more insights into this icy moon.

💡 Fun Fact
Titania is named after the queen of the fairies in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, continuing the theme of fairytale-inspired names for moons of Uranus!
