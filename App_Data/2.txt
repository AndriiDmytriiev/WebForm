🪐 Quick Facts about Venus
Position from the Sun: 2nd

Average distance from the Sun: ~108 million km (67 million miles)

Diameter: 12,104 km (7,521 miles) – almost the same as Earth's

Length of a day (rotation): ~243 Earth days (and it rotates backward – retrograde!)

Length of a year (orbit): ~225 Earth days

Moons: None

Atmosphere: Very thick – mostly carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid

Surface temperature: ~465°C (869°F) day and night

Surface pressure: 92 times that of Earth (like being 900 meters underwater)

🔥 Why Venus Is So Extreme
It’s the hottest planet in the Solar System – even hotter than Mercury – because of a runaway greenhouse effect.

Its thick clouds reflect ~70% of sunlight, making it very bright – often called the "Evening Star" or "Morning Star."

Its day (243 Earth days) is longer than its year (225 Earth days)!
