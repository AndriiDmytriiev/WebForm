🪐 Quick Facts about Jupiter
Position from the Sun: 5th

Average distance from the Sun: ~778 million km (484 million miles)

Diameter: 139,820 km (86,881 miles) – about 11 times Earth's diameter

Mass: ~318 times the mass of Earth

Length of a day (rotation): ~9.9 hours (the shortest day in the Solar System)

Length of a year (orbit): ~11.86 Earth years

Moons: 95 (including the four largest: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, known as the Galilean moons)

Atmosphere: Mainly hydrogen (about 90%) and helium (about 10%)

Surface temperature:

Top cloud layer: ~-145°C (-234°F)

Core temperature: ~24,000°C (43,000°F)

Magnetic field: Stronger than any other planet in the Solar System

🌩️ Jupiter’s Atmosphere and Weather
Known for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm that’s been raging for at least 400 years!

Its atmosphere is made up of cloud bands of different colors due to ammonia, methane, and other chemicals.

Experiences violent storms and high winds, with wind speeds reaching up to 432 km/h (268 mph).

🌌 Jupiter’s Rings and Moons
Rings: Jupiter has faint rings made mostly of dust particles and ice.

Galilean Moons:

Io – the most volcanic body in the Solar System, with over 400 active volcanoes.

Europa – believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, a potential location for life.

Ganymede – the largest moon in the Solar System, even bigger than Mercury!

Callisto – heavily cratered, and some scientists speculate it might have an underground ocean.

🚀 Exploration of Jupiter
Pioneer 10 and 11 (NASA, 1970s) were the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter.

Voyager 1 and 2 (1980s) sent back amazing data about Jupiter’s atmosphere and moons.

Galileo (1995–2003) orbited Jupiter, giving detailed data on its moons and magnetic field.

Juno Mission (2016–present) is currently studying Jupiter’s atmosphere, magnetic field, and overall structure.

🌠 Why Jupiter Is Important
Jupiter's strong magnetic field protects the inner Solar System from solar radiation.

It may have played a key role in shaping the orbits and development of other planets, especially through gravitational interactions with comets and asteroids.

Jupiter’s moons, especially Europa, are high-priority targets for astrobiology due to the possibility of life beneath their icy shells.
