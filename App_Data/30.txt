🌙 Hydra at a Glance
Property	Details
🌍 Orbits	Pluto
🧠 Name Origin	Named after the Hydra, the nine-headed serpent guarding the underworld in Greek mythology
📏 Size	~43 × 33 km (irregular shape)
🌌 Distance from Pluto	~64,700 km (farthest known moon)
🌀 Orbital Period	~38.2 Earth days
🔁 Rotation	Chaotic – tumbles in space
💡 Reflectivity	Very bright, high in water ice
📅 Discovered	2005 (by Hubble Space Telescope)
🛰 Explored by	NASA’s New Horizons in 2015
🔭 Discovery and Naming
Discovered in June 2005 by the Pluto Companion Search Team using the Hubble Space Telescope.

Named Hydra after the mythological serpent—a nod to Pluto’s underworld theme and to the initials “H” for the Hubble Space Telescope.

🌌 Orbit and Motion
Orbits beyond Nix and all other known Pluto moons except for occasional debris.

Exhibits chaotic rotation, meaning it tumbles unpredictably rather than spinning in a steady, regular way.

Keeps to a near-circular orbit, aligned with Pluto’s other small moons.

🧊 Surface and Composition
Appears brighter than expected—indicating a surface rich in water ice.

Highly reflective, even more so than Nix or Charon.

Likely shaped by impact events, with surface craters seen in New Horizons images.

🛰 What New Horizons Saw
When NASA’s New Horizons flew past Pluto in 2015, it captured:

Detailed images showing Hydra's irregular shape

Bright icy surface with impact craters

Confirmation of chaotic rotation

Support for the giant impact theory of Pluto's moon formation

🔁 How Hydra Fits Into the Pluto System
Part of a miniature moon system orbiting the Pluto–Charon binary.

Along with Styx, Nix, and Kerberos, it may have formed from debris after a massive collision early in Pluto’s history.

Its chaotic tumbling is due to gravitational interactions with both Pluto and Charon.

✨ Fun Facts
Hydra is the second-brightest of Pluto's small moons (after Nix).

It rotates roughly once every 10 hours, but with chaotic spin.

Though it’s tiny, Hydra contributes to our understanding of Kuiper Belt object evolution.
