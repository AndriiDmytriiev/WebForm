🌟 Ganymede at a Glance
Feature	Info
🪐 Orbits	Jupiter (Galilean moon)
📅 Discovered	1610 by Galileo Galilei
📏 Diameter	5,268 km (3,273 mi) — larger than Mercury
🛰 Orbital Period	~7.15 Earth days
🌡 Surface Temp	~ -113 °C (day) to -193 °C (night)
🌊 Key Feature	Subsurface saltwater ocean, possibly deeper than Earth’s oceans
☁ Atmosphere	Very thin; contains oxygen (but not breathable)
🧲 Magnetic Field	Only moon with its own magnetic field
📡 Missions	Voyager, Galileo, Juno, and upcoming JUICE (ESA)
🌊 What's Special About Ganymede?
Biggest moon in the Solar System — even bigger than Mercury (but less massive).

Believed to host a layered internal ocean, sandwiched between layers of ice — possibly up to 800 km deep!

Has both light terrain (older, heavily cratered) and dark terrain (younger, grooved, possibly from tectonic activity).

🧲 Magnetic Mystery
Ganymede has its own intrinsic magnetic field — unique among all moons.
This causes auroras near its poles and hints at liquid metal or salty water beneath its surface.

🌐 Surface and Interior
Surface: A mix of water ice, silicate rock, craters, and ridges

Geological activity: Past tectonic-like movements and icy resurfacing

Interior structure: Likely includes a metallic core, rocky mantle, high-pressure ice layers, and liquid water

🚀 Exploration
Voyager 1 & 2 (1979): First close-ups of Ganymede

Galileo Orbiter (1995–2003): Provided most of what we know today

Juno: Conducted a close flyby in 2021

JUICE mission (by ESA, launching 2023, arriving ~2031): Will orbit Ganymede – first time any spacecraft orbits a moon other than our own!

🧬 Possibility of Life?
Ganymede’s ocean may touch a rocky seafloor → a possible energy source

It's considered a potential candidate in the search for extremophile life — though conditions may be less favorable than Europa

🌌 Fun Fact
If Ganymede orbited the Sun instead of Jupiter, it would be classified as a planet because of its size and internal complexity.
