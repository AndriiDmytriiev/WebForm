🏞 Surface Features
Cratered Terrain: Oberon’s surface is heavily cratered, which suggests it is an old moon with many impacts over time. The largest craters can be up to 200 km in diameter.

Fractures and Rifts: The moon also has large rift valleys and fractured terrains, indicating that there may have been some geological activity in the past, possibly linked to tidal forces from Uranus.

Oberon’s surface is made of a mixture of water ice, rock, and frozen methane, giving it a somewhat bright appearance. Its frosted surface reflects sunlight, making it one of the more visible moons of Uranus from afar.

🧊 Composition
Oberon is composed mainly of ice and rock. The ice makes up a significant portion of its surface, while the core is likely a mixture of rock and metal.

Scientists believe that Oberon’s surface may have experienced some internal heating in the past, possibly from tidal forces or radioactive decay, which could have caused subsurface melting and the development of geological features like fractures and canyons.

🌌 Geological History
Like other moons of Uranus, Oberon likely experienced some form of geological activity in the distant past, driven by forces such as tidal heating or impacts.

Some of the fractures on Oberon’s surface could have been caused by tectonic activity or the expansion of ice beneath the surface, similar to what we see on other icy moons in the Solar System.

🚀 Exploration
Voyager 2: Oberon was visited by Voyager 2 in 1986 during its flyby of the Uranian system. The spacecraft captured the first detailed images of Oberon’s surface, revealing its heavily cratered and fractured terrain.

No follow-up missions have visited Oberon since Voyager 2, but future missions to the Uranian system may offer more insights into the moon's geological features and potential subsurface activity.
