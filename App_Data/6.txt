🌑 Quick Facts about Phobos
Parent Planet: Mars

Discovered: 1877 by Asaph Hall

Name Origin: Greek for "fear" (named after one of the sons of Ares/Mars)

Distance from Mars: ~6,000 km (3,700 miles) – closer to its planet than any other moon in the Solar System

Dimensions: ~27 × 22 × 18 km (not spherical – potato-shaped)

Orbital period: ~7 hours 39 minutes – orbits Mars 3 times a day!

Surface gravity: ~0.0006g (you could almost jump off it)

Atmosphere: None

Surface: Dark, dusty, heavily cratered, with grooves likely caused by tidal forces or impacts

☄️ Interesting Features
Stickney Crater: A giant impact crater (9 km wide) that dominates one side of Phobos

Surface covered in a layer of regolith (dust and rock fragments), possibly a meter deep

Appears to be gradually spiraling inward toward Mars — might crash or break apart in 30–50 million years

🚀 Missions & Studies
Studied by many Mars missions (Mariner, Viking, Mars Express, etc.)

Japan’s Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission plans to land on Phobos around 2029 and return samples to Earth!

🧩 Mystery Moon
Its origin is unclear: might be a captured asteroid or formed from a massive impact on Mars

Its extremely low density suggests it's not solid rock — possibly a “rubble pile”
