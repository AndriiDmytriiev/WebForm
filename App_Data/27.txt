🔭 Discovery and Reclassification
Discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh.

Held planetary status until 2006, when the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified it as a dwarf planet, because it:

Orbits the Sun ✅

Is spherical in shape ✅

Has not cleared its orbital neighborhood ❌

🌌 Orbit and Rotation
Orbit: Pluto has a highly eccentric (oval-shaped) and tilted orbit. Sometimes, it's even closer to the Sun than Neptune.

Day Length: One day on Pluto is about 6.4 Earth days.

Year Length: It takes about 248 Earth years to complete one orbit.

🌍 Surface and Atmosphere
Surface: Pluto's surface is a stunning mix of nitrogen ice, methane ice, and carbon monoxide ice, with mountains, valleys, and plains.

Color: Ranges from light tan to dark reddish-brown, due to tholins — organic molecules formed by solar radiation.

Heart-shaped Glacier: The famous "Sputnik Planitia", a large icy plain shaped like a heart, became iconic after the New Horizons flyby.

Atmosphere: Thin and composed mostly of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. It expands when Pluto is closer to the Sun and collapses when it’s farther away.

🌌 Moons of Pluto
Pluto has 5 known moons:

Charon – Largest moon, nearly half Pluto's size; Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system.

Styx

Nix

Kerberos

Hydra

Charon is so large relative to Pluto that they orbit a common center of gravity outside of Pluto itself!

🛰 New Horizons Mission (2015)
NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft gave us our first detailed look at Pluto during its historic flyby on July 14, 2015.

Key discoveries:

Mountains of water ice

A young surface, geologically active

Atmospheric haze layers

Complex climate and seasonal cycles

✨ Fun Facts
Named after the Roman god of the underworld (suggested by an 11-year-old girl).

A day on Pluto is longer than a week on Earth (~6.4 Earth days).

Despite being far from the Sun, Pluto shows signs of geological activity — possibly due to internal heating.

🌠 Why Pluto is Special
Pluto captures the imagination because it’s:

A symbol of exploration and the edge of the solar system

Scientifically valuable for understanding ice dwarf planets

Emotionally iconic as the "planet that was, then wasn't"
