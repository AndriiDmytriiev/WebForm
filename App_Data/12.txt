🌒 Callisto at a Glance
Feature	Info
🪐 Orbits	Jupiter (Galilean moon)
📅 Discovered	1610 by Galileo Galilei
📏 Diameter	4,821 km (just a bit smaller than Mercury)
🛰 Orbital Period	~16.7 Earth days
🌡 Surface Temp	~ -139 °C (day) to -193 °C (night)
🧊 Surface	Ice + rock, extremely heavily cratered
🌊 Key Feature	Possible subsurface ocean (~100 km deep)
🔋 Magnetic Clues	Induced magnetic field → may indicate salty liquid water
📡 Missions	Voyager, Galileo, Juno, and future ESA missions (JUICE flybys)
🪨 What Makes Callisto Unique?
It’s the most heavily cratered object in the Solar System

Its surface is very old — over 4 billion years, preserving a record of early Solar System impacts

No tectonic activity or resurfacing → it’s geologically "dead," but fascinating historically

Despite being inactive, it may still have a liquid ocean beneath the icy crust

🧬 Possibility of Life?
Less likely than Europa or Ganymede due to:

No contact between the ocean and a rocky seafloor (possibly)

No tectonic or volcanic activity = fewer energy sources

But: The deep, salty ocean (if confirmed) still makes Callisto worth considering as a life-hosting body

🌌 Surface and Structure
Covered in bright ice, dark dust, and massive impact scars

Home to Valhalla Crater, one of the largest impact basins in the Solar System

Internal structure: Likely differentiated into ice, rock, and possibly a water layer

🚀 Exploration
Voyager 1 & 2 (1979): Initial imaging

Galileo (1996–2003): Found signs of possible ocean

Juno: Has gathered additional data from afar

JUICE (ESA): Will perform flybys, though main focus is Ganymede

💡 Fun Fact
Because Callisto is far from Jupiter’s radiation belts, it’s considered the safest place for a future human base around Jupiter.
