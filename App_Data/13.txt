💍 What Makes Saturn So Special?
The Rings: Made mostly of ice and rock particles — from microscopic dust to mountain-sized chunks
→ Stretch out over 280,000 km, but are only ~10 m thick in most places!

Low Density: Saturn is the only planet that would float in water (if there were a big enough bathtub 🛁)

Weather: Known for its huge storms and a bizarre hexagon-shaped jet stream at the north pole

🌑 Saturn's Moon Squad
Titan: Larger than Mercury; has a thick atmosphere, lakes of liquid methane, and a subsurface water ocean

Enceladus: Icy moon with water plumes spraying from its south pole → could support microbial life

Others include Mimas ("Death Star moon"), Iapetus (two-toned), Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Hyperion, and more

🚀 Exploration Timeline
Pioneer 11 (1979): First flyby

Voyager 1 & 2 (1980–81): Incredible close-ups of rings and moons

Cassini (2004–2017): Most detailed study ever – orbited Saturn for 13 years, deployed the Huygens lander to Titan

Dragonfly mission (launching ~2027, arriving ~2034): Will explore Titan by drone 🛸

🌌 Fun Fact
Saturn's rings may be relatively young — possibly only 100–200 million years old, and might disappear over the next 100 million years!
