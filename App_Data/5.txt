🏜️ Mars' Landscape
Known for its reddish appearance due to iron oxide (rust)

Home to:

Olympus Mons – tallest volcano in the solar system (~22 km or 13.6 miles high)

Valles Marineris – a canyon system over 4,000 km long

Polar ice caps made of water and dry ice (frozen CO₂)

Evidence of ancient rivers, lakes, and maybe even oceans

Sojourner (1997), Spirit & Opportunity, Curiosity (still active), and Perseverance (2021–present)

Orbiters: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, Mars Express, Tianwen-1, and more

Future Plans: Human missions in the 2030s (NASA, SpaceX, etc.)

🧬 Why Mars Matters
It's the most Earth-like planet in terms of day length and seasons

Scientists are searching for signs of ancient life

A candidate for future colonization thanks to potential water sources and manageable surface conditions
