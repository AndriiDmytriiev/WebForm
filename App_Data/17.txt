🌍 Mimas at a Glance
Feature	Info
🪐 Orbits	Saturn
📏 Diameter	396 km (about a third the size of Earth's Moon)
🌡 Surface Temp	~ -203 °C (-333 °F)
💥 Key Feature	Huge crater, Herschel, which makes it look like the Death Star
🧊 Surface Features	Icy, heavily cratered, with a very old surface
🌚 Atmosphere	Almost none (extremely thin)
🚀 Missions	Cassini (flybys)
💥 Herschel Crater: The "Death Star" Feature
Herschel Crater is the largest and most obvious feature on Mimas’ surface:

It’s about 130 km wide — nearly a third of Mimas' entire diameter!

The impact that formed this crater nearly fractured the entire moon, which is why it’s so distinctive

There are rays of material surrounding the crater, giving it a dramatic appearance

🧊 Surface and Structure
Ice and rock are the primary components of Mimas' surface. It’s an old and heavily cratered moon, suggesting little to no geological activity

Mimas has large fractures and mountains around the impact crater — possibly remnants of the moon trying to heal from the enormous impact

Like many moons of Saturn, Mimas is likely mostly ice with a small rocky core inside

🚀 Exploration
Cassini (2004–2017): Conducted multiple flybys and gave us stunning close-up images of Mimas’ surface, especially the Herschel crater

Although no landers have visited Mimas, Cassini’s data helped scientists analyze the composition of its surface and understand its lack of geological activity

💡 Fun Fact
The Herschel Crater on Mimas is so large and impactful that it makes Mimas look like the Death Star from Star Wars — and this resemblance is actually what earned it the nickname!
