🌌 Key Facts About Triton:
Discovered by: British astronomer William Lassell in 1846, just 17 days after Neptune itself was discovered.

Diameter: ~2,710 km (1,680 miles) – slightly smaller than Earth’s Moon.

Orbital Direction: Retrograde – Triton orbits Neptune backwards, opposite to the planet’s rotation. This is very rare and suggests it was captured by Neptune’s gravity, possibly a former dwarf planet from the Kuiper Belt.

Surface: Covered in ice, with nitrogen geysers and evidence of cryovolcanism (ice volcanoes).

Atmosphere: Thin, made mostly of nitrogen, with traces of methane – somewhat similar to Pluto.

Temperature: Extremely cold, around −235 °C (−391 °F).

Future: Because of its retrograde orbit, Triton is slowly spiraling inward and may one day either crash into Neptune or be torn apart, forming a ring system.

🛰️ Exploration
Triton has only been visited once – by NASA’s Voyager 2 in 1989. The flyby revealed:

A smooth, young surface with few impact craters (suggesting geological activity).

Mysterious dark streaks from nitrogen geysers shooting particles up to 8 km (5 miles) high.
