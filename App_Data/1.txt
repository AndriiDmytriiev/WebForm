🔭 Interesting Facts
Mercury has no atmosphere to trap heat, which causes huge temperature swings.

It has a large iron core, making up about 85% of the planet's radius.

Surface features resemble the Moon: lots of craters, ridges, and plains.

Mariner 10 and MESSENGER are the main missions that have studied it.

A new mission, BepiColombo, launched by ESA and JAXA, is en route and will arrive in 2025.
