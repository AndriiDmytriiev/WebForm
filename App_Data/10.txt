🌍 Europa at a Glance
Feature	Info
🪐 Orbits	Jupiter (Galilean moon)
📅 Discovered	1610 by Galileo Galilei
📏 Diameter	3,122 km (slightly smaller than Earth’s Moon)
🛰 Orbital period	~3.55 days
🌡 Surface temp	~ -160 °C (-260 °F)
🌊 Key Feature	Global subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust
🎨 Surface	Bright, smooth, with cracks and ridges of brown-red material
📡 Missions	Voyager, Galileo, Juno, and the upcoming Europa Clipper (2020s)
🌊 Why Europa Is So Fascinating
Beneath its icy shell, Europa likely hides a liquid water ocean — possibly 2–3 times more water than Earth has!

Tidal heating from Jupiter’s gravity keeps the ocean from freezing, just like with Io (but less volcanic).

The icy crust is estimated to be 10–30 km thick, with the ocean possibly 60–150 km deep underneath.

🧬 Could There Be Life?
Europa is considered one of the best places in the Solar System to search for life:

Liquid water ✅

Heat source (from tidal forces) ✅

Organic compounds (potentially) ✅

Some scientists believe hydrothermal vents on Europa’s ocean floor could resemble Earth's deep-sea vents — which host entire ecosystems without sunlight.

🧊 Surface and Features
Europa’s surface is smooth and bright, mostly ice, with very few craters (meaning it’s geologically young).

It features chaotic terrain with broken ice blocks, ridges, and red-brown streaks likely from salts or sulfur compounds.

Occasional water vapor plumes have been detected — possibly linked to eruptions from the ocean below.

🚀 Exploration Missions
Voyager 1 & 2 (1979): First close-up images

Galileo Orbiter (1995–2003): Mapped the surface in detail and found strong evidence for a subsurface ocean

Juno (currently orbiting Jupiter): Occasionally performs flybys

Europa Clipper (launching 2024–2025): Will make ~50 flybys of Europa, study its ice shell, ocean, and look for biosignatures
