🌌 Distance from Pluto	~42,000 km
🌀 Orbital Period	~20.2 Earth days
🔁 Rotation	Chaotic (non-synchronous, tumbling)
💡 Surface	Bright, likely rich in water ice
📅 Discovered	2012 (Hubble Space Telescope)
🛰 Imaged by	NASA's New Horizons (2015)
🔭 Discovery and Naming
Discovered in 2012 using the Hubble Space Telescope.

The name "Styx" follows the underworld theme, referencing the mythological river that forms the boundary between Earth and the underworld.

🧊 Appearance and Composition
Highly reflective, suggesting a surface made mostly of water ice.

Small and faint, making it difficult to observe clearly even with space telescopes.

🔁 Orbit and Spin
Located between Charon and Nix, making it the closest small moon to Pluto.

Like the other small moons, Styx tumbles chaotically rather than rotating in a regular, predictable way.

Orbits in the same plane as Pluto’s other moons, in a nearly circular path.

🛰 New Horizons Observations
New Horizons captured images showing:

Styx’s elongated shape

No obvious large craters

Bright icy surface, brighter than expected from earlier Hubble data

🌌 Why Styx Matters
Styx helps complete the story of Pluto’s formation and its moon system.

It supports the theory of a giant impact forming Pluto’s smaller moons from debris.

Styx's chaotic motion also informs our understanding of multi-body gravitational systems.
