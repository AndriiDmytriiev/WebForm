ðŸŒ˜ Quick Facts about the Moon
Distance from Earth: ~384,400 km (238,855 miles)

Diameter: 3,474 km (2,159 miles) â€“ about 1/4 the size of Earth

Gravity: ~1/6 of Earthâ€™s

Orbital period (around Earth): ~27.3 days

Rotational period (day length): ~27.3 days (same as its orbit â€“ thatâ€™s why we always see the same side!)

Surface temperature:

Day: up to 127Â°C (260Â°F)

Night: down to -173Â°C (-280Â°F)

Atmosphere: None (just a very thin exosphere)

ðŸŒ‘ The Moonâ€™s Surface
Covered in craters, maria (dark basalt plains), and highlands

No liquid water, but ice has been found in permanently shadowed craters

The far side is more rugged and cratered â€” and was unseen until 1959
