📏 Diameter	50,724 km (about 4 times the size of Earth)
🌫 Atmosphere	Mostly hydrogen, helium, and methane
🌡 Temperature	-224 °C (-371 °F) (the coldest planet in the Solar System)
🌚 Rings	13 rings, mostly made of ice and rock, faint compared to Saturn’s
💨 Winds	Extremely fast winds (~900 km/h, 560 mph) in the atmosphere
🌌 Moons	27 known moons, including Miranda, Ariel, and Titania
🚀 Exploration	Voyager 2 (1986)
🌀 The Tilted Axis
Uranus is tilted on its side — about 98 degrees from its orbital plane! This means its poles are almost in the plane of its orbit, unlike any other planet in the Solar System. It essentially rolls around the Sun rather than orbiting like most planets.

This extreme tilt causes its seasons to be unlike any other planet. Each pole gets about 42 years of continuous sunlight or darkness!

🌬 Extreme Winds and Weather
Uranus has super-fast winds, with speeds reaching up to 900 km/h (560 mph).

Despite being far from the Sun, Uranus emits more heat than it receives. Scientists are still unsure where the extra heat comes from, but it could be residual from the planet's formation or some unknown internal process.

💨 Atmosphere and Blue-Green Color
The atmosphere is made up of mostly hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane in the atmosphere absorbs red light and reflects blue and green, giving the planet its signature blue-green color.

Uranus’ atmosphere also contains clouds made of water ice and ammonia ice. Despite being far from the Sun, it has a complex weather system with clouds and storms.

💍 Rings and Moons
Rings: Uranus has 13 faint rings made of dark particles, mostly composed of ice and rock. They are much less visible and distinct than Saturn’s famous rings.

Moons: Uranus has 27 known moons with intriguing features. Some of the largest include:

Miranda: Has one of the most distorted landscapes in the Solar System, with strange cliffs and ridges.

Ariel and Titania: These moons are icy and have geological features like craters and rifts.

🚀 Exploration
Voyager 2: The only spacecraft to have visited Uranus, Voyager 2 flew by the planet in 1986. It took some of the most detailed images of Uranus and its rings and moons, but we still don’t know much about the planet.

No missions are currently planned to explore Uranus, but future missions could help us learn more about its extreme tilt, its internal structure, and its potential for life.

💡 Fun Fact
Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any planet in the Solar System, with temperatures that can drop to -224 °C (-371 °F), colder than Neptune, which is farther from the Sun!
