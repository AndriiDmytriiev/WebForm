🛰 Visited by	Imaged by New Horizons in 2015
📅 Discovered	2005 (Hubble Space Telescope)
🔭 Discovery and Naming
Discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2005, along with Hydra.

Named after Nix, the mother of Charon (ferryman of the dead) in Greek mythology — a fitting theme for Pluto’s moons, all named after underworld figures.

🧊 Surface and Appearance
Color: Pale, slightly reddish

Surface: Likely composed of water ice, with few visible craters, suggesting relatively young surface regions.

New Horizons captured images showing crater-like depressions, which hint at past collisions.

🔁 Rotation and Orbit
Chaotic rotation: Unlike Earth’s Moon, Nix spins unpredictably — tumbling as it orbits Pluto due to the complex gravitational effects of Pluto and Charon.

It’s not tidally locked like Charon.

The orbit is nearly circular and in the same plane as Pluto’s other small moons.

🛰 New Horizons Discoveries
First detailed images of Nix showed its irregular shape and bright surface.

Confirmed the chaotic motion of Pluto’s small moons.

Helped scientists understand more about the formation and evolution of the Pluto system — likely formed by a giant impact.

🌌 Why Nix Matters
Nix, despite its small size, is key to understanding:

The aftermath of the Pluto–Charon collision

The dynamics of multi-moon systems

How icy bodies behave in chaotic orbital environments
