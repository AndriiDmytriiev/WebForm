🌍 Rhea at a Glance
Feature	Info
🪐 Orbits	Saturn
📏 Diameter	1,527 km (about half the size of Earth’s Moon)
🌡 Surface Temp	~ -217 °C (-359 °F)
💧 Surface Features	Cratered surface with bright ice and dark material
🌚 Atmosphere	Extremely thin (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide)
💍 Rings	Faint rings, likely made of ice particles, discovered by Cassini
🌊 Subsurface Ocean	Possibly an ocean under icy surface (like Enceladus)
🚀 Missions	Cassini (2004–2017)
🧊 Surface and Structure
Bright, icy surface with many impact craters, some of which are over 500 km in diameter

The surface is very reflective because it’s mostly water ice mixed with rock

May have a partially differentiated interior (rocky core and icy outer layers)

Scientists suspect there could be a subsurface ocean, but it’s not as confirmed as Enceladus or Titan

🌌 Faint Rings and Magnetic Field
Rhea has two faint rings made of icy particles — the first moon discovered to have rings!

These rings are very tenuous and much less noticeable than Saturn’s main rings

Rhea also has a magnetic field, suggesting it might have a metallic core or other unique interior characteristics

🚀 Exploration
Cassini (2004–2017): Provided high-resolution images of Rhea’s surface and studied its faint ring system

No landers have visited Rhea yet, but Cassini’s flybys have helped us understand its surface and atmosphere better

💡 Fun Fact
Rhea is the second-largest moon of Saturn and has the lowest density of any major moon in the Solar System, meaning it’s made mostly of ice (and a little bit of rock)!
