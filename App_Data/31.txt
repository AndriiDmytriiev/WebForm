🧠 Mythological Name
"Kerberos" is the Greek spelling of Cerberus, the famous three-headed hound that guards the entrance to Hades in Greek mythology.

Fits perfectly with Pluto’s theme of naming moons after underworld figures.

🔭 Discovery Details
Found using the Hubble Space Telescope during preparations for the New Horizons flyby.

One of the last Pluto moons discovered, due to its small size and faint brightness.

🧊 Composition and Features
Kerberos was expected to be darker, but New Horizons revealed a highly reflective surface.

Likely covered in clean water ice, making it brighter than scientists predicted based on Hubble images.

Appears as a double-lobed object, suggesting it may be two smaller bodies merged together.

🔁 Orbit and Spin
Orbits between Nix and Hydra.

Like Pluto’s other small moons, Kerberos exhibits chaotic rotation—it tumbles unpredictably due to the complex gravitational interplay between Pluto and Charon.

✨ Why Kerberos Is Interesting
Helps support the theory that Pluto’s moons formed from a giant collision early in its history.

Shows that even tiny moons can have complex histories and unexpected properties.

Its bright, icy surface defied expectations and helped refine our models of how icy bodies behave in the outer solar system.
