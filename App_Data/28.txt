🌑 Charon at a Glance
Property	Details
🌍 Orbits	Pluto
📏 Diameter	~1,212 km (about 50% of Pluto’s diameter)
📏 Size Ratio	Largest moon relative to its planet
🌀 Orbital Period	~6.4 Earth days (same as Pluto's rotation)
🔁 Rotation	Synchronous (always shows same face to Pluto)
🧊 Composition	Water ice, ammonia hydrates, rocky core
🛰 Explored by	NASA's New Horizons (2015)
🧠 Name Origin	Named after Charon, the ferryman of the dead in Greek mythology
🌌 Pluto–Charon System: A Cosmic Dance
Binary System: Because Charon is about half the size of Pluto, the two orbit a common barycenter that lies outside Pluto’s surface.

Both bodies are tidally locked, meaning they always show the same face to each other — a rare cosmic relationship.

Distance from Pluto: ~19,600 km (very close in astronomical terms)

🧊 Surface and Features
Color: Much grayer and less red than Pluto — its surface is dominated by water ice.

"Mordor": The nickname for the large, dark reddish region near Charon’s north pole, possibly made of tholins (organic molecules formed by solar radiation on methane).

Canyons and Cliffs: Charon has massive chasms and fractured terrain, hinting at past tectonic activity — possibly from an internal ocean that froze and expanded.

🌠 Formation Theory
Charon likely formed from a giant impact, similar to how Earth’s Moon may have formed. A collision between Pluto and another Kuiper Belt object could have ejected debris that coalesced into Charon.

🚀 Discovery
Discovered: In 1978 by astronomer James Christy

The discovery helped scientists determine Pluto’s mass, which had been difficult to estimate before.

🛰 New Horizons Discoveries (2015)
NASA's New Horizons spacecraft revealed:

Surface fractures and ice cliffs several kilometers deep

A surprisingly young surface in some areas

Evidence of cryovolcanism (ice volcanoes)

No detectable atmosphere, unlike Pluto

✨ Why Charon is Fascinating
It blurs the line between moon and planet.

It provides insight into binary planetary systems.

Its surface features suggest a complex geological history, not just a dead chunk of rock.
